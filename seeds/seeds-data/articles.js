    "content": '<div><em>The most beloved story by British author Beatrix Potter, published in 1902.<img alt="Peter Rabbit cover" src="https://assets.americanliterature.com/al/images/story/peter-rabbit.jpg" /></em><p>ONCE upon a time there were four little Rabbits, and their names were— Flopsy, Mopsy, Cotton-tail, and Peter.</p><p>They lived with their Mother in a sand-bank, underneath the root of a very big fir tree.</p><p>&quot;NOW, my dears,&quot; said old Mrs. Rabbit one morning, &quot;you may go into the fields or down the lane, but don\'t go into Mr. McGregor\'s garden: your Father had an accident there; he was put in a pie by Mrs. McGregor.&quot;</p><p>&quot;NOW run along, and don\'t get into mischief. I am going out.&quot;</p><p>THEN old Mrs. Rabbit took a basket and her umbrella, to the baker\'s. She bought a loaf of brown bread and five currant buns.</p><p>FLOPSY, Mopsy, and Cottontail, who were good little bunnies, went down the lane to gather blackberries;</p><p><img alt="Peter Rabbit gate" src="https://assets.americanliterature.com/al/images/story/peter-rabbit-b.jpg" />BUT Peter, who was very naughty, ran straight away to Mr. McGregor\'s garden and squeezed under the gate!</p><p>FIRST he ate some lettuces and some French beans; and then he ate some radishes;</p><p>AND then, feeling rather sick, he went to look for some parsley.</p><p>BUT round the end of a cucumber frame, whom should he meet but Mr. McGregor!</p><p>MR. McGREGOR was on his hands and knees planting out young cabbages, but he jumped up and ran after Peter, waving a rake and calling out, &quot;Stop thief!&quot;</p><p>PETER was most dreadfully frightened; he rushed all over the garden, for he had forgotten the way back to the gate.</p><p>He lost one of his shoes among the cabbages, and the other shoe amongst the potatoes.</p><p>AFTER losing them, he ran on four legs and went faster, so that I think he might have got away altogether if he had not unfortunately run into a gooseberry net, and got caught by the large buttons on his jacket. It was a blue jacket with brass buttons, quite new.</p><p><img alt="Peter Rabbit gooseberry next" src="https://assets.americanliterature.com/al/images/story/peter-rabbit-d.jpg" />PETER gave himself up for lost, and shed big tears; but his sobs were overheard by some friendly sparrows, who flew to him in great excitement, and implored him to exert himself.</p><p>MR. McGREGOR came up with a sieve, which he intended to pop upon the top of Peter; but Peter wriggled out just in time, leaving his jacket behind him.</p><p>AND rushed into the toolshed, and jumped into a can. It would have been a beautiful thing to hide in, if it had not had so much water in it.</p><p>MR. McGREGOR was quite sure that Peter was somewhere in the toolshed, perhaps hidden underneath a flower-pot. He began to turn them over carefully, looking under each.</p><p>Presently Peter sneezed— &quot;Kertyschoo!&quot; Mr. McGregor was after him in no time,</p><p>AND tried to put his foot upon Peter, who jumped out of a window, upsetting three plants. The window was too small for Mr. McGregor, and he was tired of running after Peter. He went back to his work.</p><p>PETER sat down to rest; he was out of breath and trembling with fright, and he had not the least idea which way to go. Also he was very damp with sitting in that can.</p><p>After a time he began to wander about, going lippity— lippity—not very fast, and looking all around.</p><p>HE found a door in a wall; but it was locked, and there was no room for a fat little rabbit to squeeze underneath.</p><p>An old mouse was running in and out over the stone doorstep, carrying peas and beans to her family in the wood. Peter asked her the way to the gate, but she had such a large pea in her mouth that she could not answer. She only shook her head at him. Peter began to cry.</p><p><img alt="Peter Rabbit in wheelbarrow" src="https://assets.americanliterature.com/al/images/story/peter-rabbit-2.jpg" />THEN he tried to find his way straight across the garden, but he became more and more puzzled. Presently, he came to a pond where Mr. McGregor filled his water-cans. A white cat was staring at some gold-fish; she sat very, very still, but now and then the tip of her tail twitched as if it were alive. Peter thought it best to go away without speaking to her; he had heard about cats from his cousin, little Benjamin Bunny.</p><p>HE went back towards the tool-shed, but suddenly, quite close to him, he heard the noise of a hoe—scr-r-ritch, scratch, scratch, scritch. Peter scuttered underneath the bushes. But presently, as nothing happened, he came out, and climbed upon a wheelbarrow, and peeped over. The first thing he saw was Mr. McGregor hoeing onions. His back was turned towards Peter, and beyond him was the gate!</p><p>PETER got down very quietly off the wheelbarrow, and started running as fast as he could go, along a straight walk behind some black-currant bushes.</p><p>Mr. McGregor caught sight of him at the corner, but Peter did not care. He slipped underneath the gate, and was safe at last in the wood outside the garden.</p><p><img alt="Peter Rabbit hung coat shoes" src="https://assets.americanliterature.com/al/images/story/peter-rabbit-c.jpg" />MR. McGREGOR hung up the little jacket and the shoes for a scare-crow to frighten the blackbirds.</p><p>PETER never stopped running or looked behind him till he got home to the big fir-tree.</p><p>He was so tired that he flopped down upon the nice soft sand on the floor of the rabbit-hole, and shut his eyes. His mother was busy cooking; she wondered what he had done with his clothes. It was the second little jacket and pair of shoes that Peter had lost in a fortnight!</p><p>I AM sorry to say that Peter was not very well during the evening.</p><p>His mother put him to bed, and made some camomile tea; and she gave a dose of it to Peter!</p><p>&quot;One table-spoonful to be taken at bed-time.&quot;</p><p>BUT Flopsy, Mopsy, and Cotton-tail had bread and milk and blackberries, for supper.</p><p><img alt="Peter Rabbit siblings end" src="https://assets.americanliterature.com/al/images/story/peter-rabbit-e.jpg" /></p><p><b>THE END</b></p><p>Create a library and add your favorite stories.

    "title": "METROID: SAMUS RETURNS REVIEW",
    "content": '<div><div><p><span>Share.</span></p><span>How Samus got her groove back.</span></div><span><span>By <a href="http://people.ign.com/Samuel-IGN">Sam Claiborn</a></span></span><p>Aside from a few minor tweaks and a new look, <a href="http://www.ign.com/games/metroid-samus-returns">Metroid: Samus Returns</a> doesn’t do anything new to the series; and that’s probably for the best. Metroid has made a few wrong turns since the Metroid Prime Trilogy, with sub-par spinoffs like Federation Force and disappointing games like Other M leaving fans like myself longing for a return to the Super Metroid-style 2D adventure. Samus Returns may technically be 3D, but its 2D platforming gameplay still looks and feels like classic Metroid, and it plays even better.</p><p>This should sound familiar to Metroid Fans: In Samus Returns you explore a mesmerizing subterranean cavern with interconnecting passages that lead to dead ends as often as they lead to exciting new areas. As you explore, you upgrade your arsenal with mostly rehashed mods and beams from previous games that allow you to shoot new blocks, open special doors, or roll up ceilings, and jump over other physical obstacles. Eventually, those dead ends won’t seem so dead anymore – a satisfying feeling that became the foundation for an entire genre of map design, from Castlevania to Cave Story. And like the best Metroid games, there are no other characters and no dialogue in Samus Returns. It’s just a lady, an arm cannon, and a bounty, avoiding the pitfalls of adding other bounty hunters, space marines, and (ugh) father figures that only hurt otherwise-good Metroid games. (I’m looking at you, Adam.)</p><p>In a year when Breath of the Wild so radically reimagined Zelda, it’s surprising to get such a formulaic Metroid adventure. It’s also surprisingly satisfying, while it lasts. I found myself wanting more, even though I’d just spent 13 hours 100-percenting it.</p><p>That might’ve taken considerably longer, because Samus Returns has the biggest map of any Metroid outside of the Prime games, but probing every corner of it is made artificially easier with a new skill that reveals nearby rooms and secrets with the tap of a button. It’s basically a built-in cheat that I don’t recommend using your first time through. It might make Samus Returns friendlier for newcomers, but I relished the hours I spent poring over the maps of previous Metroids, and this feature sacrifices those moments at the altar of accessibility.</p><div><p>“</p><p>Samus looks awesome, and 3D allows for much more detail in her movements.</p></div><p>While 3D will never be as pretty as SNES-style sprites for me, I really came around on the 3D presentation. First of all, Samus looks awesome, and 3D allows for much more detail in her movements: She bends to fire down the barrel of her arm cannon and shoots over her shoulder like a badass. Second, each 2D space you move around in serves as a little window into a lush background that greatly adds to the atmosphere. Crystal caverns and rushing waterfalls glisten in the background, a large cavern opens to reveal a vast subterranean Chozo ruin, and creepy aliens laze about in the backgrounds of levels. The beauty of these backgrounds often encouraged me to turn on the 3D slider to get the full effect.</p><p>I especially appreciated the glimpse into the ruins of the Chozo civilization, the bird people who raised Samus and who were instrumental in unleashing Metroids into the galaxy, sealing their civilization’s fate. You can also unlock 3D scenes of Chozo history, accessible in the main menu. Within the game, however, there’s little to absorb lore-wise. There’s no Prime-style scanning of hieroglyphs, let alone wildlife, and I miss the world-building detail of those prior Metroid adventures.</p><div><p>“</p><p>A desperate counter can often mean the difference between life and death.</p></div><p>In gameplay, Samus Returns distinguishes itself from the old-school Metroid games it pays homage to by adding some new moves, the coolest of which is a timed counter attack. It’s an acquired taste, because you have to come to a full stop to perform a counter; the beginning of Samus Returns has you do this a lot, slowing down the otherwise-blazing pace of the action. Luckily, deeper in the campaign your weapon upgrades allow you to slice through enemies quickly, leaving counter attacks as an optional way to grind for more Aeion (which recharges special abilities). In boss fights it becomes even more useful, and a desperate counter can often mean the difference between life and death. That’s where I learned to love the new move. One particularly large boss only offered the chance at a counter after a complicated series of dodges and attacks, making the fight almost Punch-Out!!-like in its complexity.</p><p>Thanks to a few more subtle tweaks, Samus’ returning moves feel better than ever, as well. Shots are more precise when augmented by a new laser sight, she turns instantly in the air, and she can dash quickly through the levels, which are brilliantly designed to minimize time spent retreading old ground and maximize exploration. For example, an area filled with twisty little passages you navigate with careful bomb jumps early in the campaign can be utterly obliterated by a new weapon later, allowing you to just waltz through it.</p><p>Like Metroid Prime, Samus Returns cleverly places equal focus on exploration and combat, though combat does tend to get a little repetitive. You’ll see the same ugly bug faces a lot, because your ultimate goal is to kill 40 Metroid minibosses to unlock all the areas. You fight the same boss a dozen times, and then a slightly bigger version a dozen more. However, later on the bosses not only get much bigger, but they also get varied behavior. You won’t only fight Metroids, either: One miniboss is cleverly hidden, and later on some of those beasts in the background come forward to cause trouble.</p><p>The bosses get really hard – which I loved – but my long, repeated battles with some bosses raised a problem with Samus Returns’ controls. Samus’s complicated weapon options have you working the 3DS shoulder buttons, slider, and face buttons in a downright painful way. After a few tries at a tough boss, I had to put the 3DS down to rest. I’ve put in a lot of hours on 3DS games, including some tough ones, and Samus Returns ranks up there with Kid Icarus: Uprising as a top hand-cramper.</p><div><div><p>The Verdict</p><p>While it’s been marketed as a remake of Metroid II: The Return of Samus for Game Boy, <a href="http://www.ign.com/games/metroid-samus-returns">Metroid: Samus Returns</a> is more of a much-needed reboot of the 2D Metroid games we know and love. It’s a safe, modern take on Super Metroid, one of the greatest games of all time. Aside from some repetitive boss fights and hand-cramping controls, it’s nearly everything I could ask for as a fan of old-school Metroids.</p></div></div></div>',

    "title": "How JavaScript works: an overview of the engine, the runtime, and the call stack",
    "content": '<div><p>As JavaScript is getting more and more popular, teams are leveraging its support on many levels in their stack - front-end, back-end, hybrid apps, embedded devices and much more.</p><p>This post is meant to be the first in a series aimed at digging deeper into JavaScript and how it actually works: we thought that by knowing the building blocks of JavaScript and how they come to play together you’ll be able to write better code and apps.</p><p>As shown in the <a href="http://githut.info/">GitHut stats</a>, JavaScript is at the top in terms of Active Repositories and Total Pushes in GitHub. It doesn’t lag behind much in the other categories either.</p><div><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*Zf4reZZJ9DCKsXf5CSXghg.png" /></div><p>(<a href="https://madnight.github.io/githut/">Check out up-to-date GitHub language stats</a>).</p><p>If projects are getting so much dependent on JavaScript, this means that developers have to be utilizing everything that the language and the ecosystem provide with deeper and deeper understanding of the internals, in order to build amazing software.</p><p>As it turns out, there are a lot of developers that are using JavaScript on a daily basis but don’t have the knowledge of what happens under the hood.</p><h3>Overview</h3><p>Almost everyone has already heard of the V8 Engine as a concept, and most people know that JavaScript is single-threaded or that it is using a callback queue.</p><p>In this post, we’ll go through all these concepts in detail and explain how JavaScript actually runs. By knowing these details, you’ll be able to write better, non-blocking apps that are properly leveraging the provided APIs.</p><p>If you’re relatively new to JavaScript, this blog post will help you understand why JavaScript is so “weird” compared to other languages.</p><p>And if you’re an experienced JavaScript developer, hopefully, it will give you some fresh insights on how the JavaScript Runtime you’re using every day actually works.</p><h3><strong>The JavaScript Engine</strong></h3><p>A popular example of a JavaScript Engine is Google’s V8 engine. The V8 engine is used inside Chrome and Node.js for example. Here is a very simplified view of what it looks like:</p><div><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*OnH_DlbNAPvB9KLxUCyMsA.png" /></div><p>The Engine consists of two main components:<br />* Memory Heap — this is where the memory allocation happens<br />* Call Stack — this is where your stack frames are as your code executes</p><h3><strong>The Runtime</strong></h3><p>There are APIs in the browser that have been used by almost any JavaScript developer out there (e.g. “setTimeout”). Those APIs, however, are not provided by the Engine.</p><p>So, where are they coming from?</p><p>It turns out that the reality is a bit more complicated.</p><div><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*4lHHyfEhVB0LnQ3HlhSs8g.png" /></div><p>So, we have the Engine but there is actually a lot more. We have those things called Web APIs which are provided by browsers, like the DOM, AJAX, setTimeout and much more.</p><p>And then, we have the so popular <strong>event loop</strong> and the <strong>callback queue</strong>.</p><h3>The Call Stack</h3><p>JavaScript is a single-threaded programming language, which means it has a single Call Stack. Therefore it can do one thing at a time.</p><p>The Call Stack is a data structure which records basically where in the program we are. If we step into a function, we put it on the top of the stack. If we return from a function, we pop off the top of the stack. That’s all the stack can do.</p><p>Let’s see an example. Take a look at the following code:</p>function multiply(x, y) {<br />return x * y;<br />}function printSquare(x) {<br />var s = multiply(x, x);<br />console.log(s);<br />}printSquare(5);<p>When the engine starts executing this code, the Call Stack will be empty. Afterwards, the steps will be the following:</p><div><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*Yp1KOt_UJ47HChmS9y7KXw.png" /></div><p>Each entry in the Call Stack is called a <strong>Stack Frame</strong>.</p><p>And this is exactly how stack traces are being constructed when an exception is being thrown — it is basically the state of the Call Stack when the exception happened. Take a look at the following code:</p>function foo() {<br />throw new Error(\'SessionStack will help you resolve crashes :)\');<br />}function bar() {<br />foo();<br />}function start() {<br />bar();<br />}start();<p>If this is executed in Chrome (assuming that this code is in a file called foo.js), the following stack trace will be produced:</p><div><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*T-W_ihvl-9rG4dn18kP3Qw.png" /></div><p>“<strong>Blowing the stack</strong>” — this happens when you reach the maximum Call Stack size. And that could happen quite easily, especially if you’re using recursion without testing your code very extensively. Take a look at this sample code:</p>function foo() {<br />foo();<br />}foo();<p>When the engine starts executing this code, it starts with calling the function “foo”. This function, however, is recursive and starts calling itself without any termination conditions. So at every step of the execution, the same function gets added to the Call Stack over and over again. It looks something like this:</p><div><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*AycFMDy9tlDmNoc5LXd9-g.png" /></div><p>At some point, however, the number of function calls in the Call Stack exceeds the actual size of the Call Stack, and the browser decides to take action, by throwing an error, which can look something like this:</p><div><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*e0nEd59RPKz9coyY8FX-uw.png" /></div><p>Running code on a single thread can be quite easy since you don’t have to deal with complicated scenarios that are arising in multi-threaded environments — for example, deadlocks.</p><p>But running on a single thread is quite limiting as well. Since JavaScript has a single Call Stack, <strong>what happens when things are slow?</strong></p><h3><strong>Concurrency &amp; the Event Loop</strong></h3><p>What happens when you have function calls in the Call Stack that take a huge amount of time in order to be processed? For example, imagine that you want to do some complex image transformation with JavaScript in the browser.</p><p>You may ask — why is this even a problem? The problem is that while the Call Stack has functions to execute, the browser can’t actually do anything else — it’s getting blocked. This means that the browser can’t render, it can’t run any other code, it’s just stuck. And this creates problems if you want nice fluid UIs in your app.</p><p>And that’s not the only problem. Once your browser starts processing so many tasks in the Call Stack, it may stop being responsive for quite a long time. And most browsers take action by raising an error, asking you whether you want to terminate the web page.</p><div><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*WlMXK3rs_scqKTRV41au7g.jpeg" /></div><p>Now, that’s not the best user experience out there, is it?</p><p>So, how can we execute heavy code without blocking the UI and making the browser unresponsive? Well, the solution is <strong>asynchronous callbacks</strong>.</p><p>This will be explained in greater detail in <strong>Part 2</strong> of the “How JavaScript actually works” tutorial: “I<a href="https://blog.sessionstack.com/how-javascript-works-inside-the-v8-engine-5-tips-on-how-to-write-optimized-code-ac089e62b12e">nside the V8 engine + 5 tips on how to write optimized code</a>”.</p><p>In the meantime, if you’re having a hard time reproducing and understanding issues in your JavaScript apps, take a look at <a href="https://www.sessionstack.com/">SessionStack</a>. SessionStack records everything in your web apps: all DOM changes, user interactions, JavaScript exceptions, stack traces, failed network requests, and debug messages.</p><p>With SessionStack, you can replay issues in your web apps as videos and see everything that happened to your user.</p><p>There is a free plan that allows you to <a href="https://www.sessionstack.com/signup/">get started for free</a>.</p><div><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*kEQmoMuNBDfZKNSBh0tvRA.png" /></div></div>',

    "title": "PlayerUnknown\'s Battlegrounds Patch Brings Fog, Map Changes, New Weapon and More - IGN",
    "content": '<div><div><p><span>Share.</span></p><span>Streamers in the mist.</span></div><span><span>By <a href="http://people.ign.com/John_Wilds">John_Wilds</a></span></span><p>PlayerUnknown’s Battlegrounds’ September patch is coming to test servers today, bringing foggy weather, a new town, a new semi-automatic rifle and more details on the upcoming vaulting feature.</p><p>In a <a href="http://steamcommunity.com/games/578080/announcements/detail/1453956698903078380">post on the PUBG Steam page</a>, players have been given a look at a host of new features, bug fixes and soon-to-be-added features. Coming immediately to test servers will be the introduction of foggy weather to lower visibility. Don’t start sweating just yet though, as this will be a, “low probability,” weather effect in the live game (it was noted however that this will occur more frequently on the test servers).</p><p>A new town has also been snuck onto the game\'s sole (<a href="http://uk.ign.com/articles/2017/07/04/playerunknowns-battlegrounds-new-desert-map-shown-off">for now</a>) map, just East of Stalber. Users on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PUBATTLEGROUNDS/comments/6zl5sh/the_new_city_is_named_kameshki/">Reddit</a> have confirmed that it\'s a coastal settlement called Kameshki. Along with that, Stalber itself has apparently been updated, adding several more buildings on its west side.</p><div><img alt src="http://cdn.edgecast.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/clans/27971017/87f14ea1b15e02dfdb9236ad3ad715a1d2356142.jpg" /></div><p>Also coming immediately to test servers is a new gun, the Mini-14. It’s a “lightweight and compact 5.56 semi-automatic marksman rifle,” that will take sniper rifle attachments for both muzzle and magazine slots. It also takes any type of optic sight and is designed to have, “lower damage stats than other DMR\'s, which is compensated by very high muzzle velocity and low bullet drop”. In other weapon updates the Tommy Gun is now only available as a world spawn weapon and the Crossbow has had a huge reload speed buff of 35%, so we can all miss long range shots even faster.</p><p>The developers also addressed the problem that idle players can still earn currency saying they have, “…implemented rules that will not allow idle players to earn BPs.” And that they’ll continue to monitor the problem.</p><p>In a more future-facing commitment, the developers and community team outlined why the <a href="http://uk.ign.com/articles/2017/06/14/e3-2017-battlegrounds-getting-player-controlled-zombies">much requested vaulting system</a> is taking longer than expected. “First of all, our vaulting system is not built on predefined objects or locations in the map. There are tens of thousands of objects that should be vaultable or climbable in Erangel. To perform the action, the geometry and properties of each object have to be dynamically detected and analysed.” This, as the devs say is, “quite complex,” so adding the feature as quickly as fans have expected without rigorous testing could be game breaking. They did however say they are planning a test this November and until then they’ll continue working internally.</p><p>The patch notes are pretty extensive - you can see an exhaustive list on <a href="http://steamcommunity.com/games/578080/announcements/detail/1453956698903078380">Steam</a>.</p><p><a href="http://ign.com/articles/2017/09/05/pubg-hits-10-million-copies-sold">Although the game\'s sales are huge</a>, the game isn’t actually out of early access yet, with the developer reiterating that, “the entire team is hard at work to stay on track with the current roadmap and move out of Early Access before the end of Q4 2017.” More information on the official release is to come later this month.</p><p><em>John is a freelance writer for IGN UK with a love for all things stealthy, ginny and noisy.

    "title": "Looking Beyond Apple\'s IPhone \'X\' Hype To Services & The Ecosystem",
    "content": '<div><p>Apple Inc’s press conference today at 6 p.m. BST is the &quot;hot ticket&quot; for investors, with the iPhone’s latest iteration being focused on in the short-term. The market will give its verdict on the new devices on offer, but there are question marks over the anticipated $1,000 price tag and the risk that the entry point might prove too high.</p><p>It represents the biggest and most important regeneration since the iPhone 6 refresh. And, whilst there have been a few leakages and off-the-record Apple reports, there could yet be one or two surprises. There is even the potential &quot;wow&quot; factor to consider when the actual products are demonstrated live versus seeing the leaked specs.</p><p>A range of new features are anticipated, which ought to be enough to compel customers to upgrade. There are also set to be improvements to the Apple Watch (cellular connection) and to the Apple TV product.</p><p>Apple has certainly witnessed expectation around its latest iPhone reach fever pitch ahead of today’s launch. As the company’s flagship product, the device is rumored to be called the iPhone X (the X, cited by some, as referring to its exclusivity), and will be key to driving up its already huge cash pile and profitability. As such this makes the success of the launch key for investors.</p><p>In a decade or since the iPhone first launched, many of the innovative features, which it first brought to the market are no longer unique and several of those rumored to be on the iPhone X are already in existence. Notably, for example, the device being water resistant or having facial recognition software.</p><p>The share price has retreated a touch in recent days as the details of the new devices emerged Whilst this suggests the market is not bowled over by the specs, the stock leapt 1.8% on Monday ahead of the press conference, a tad shy of its all-time peak just north of $164 a pop.</p><p>Ahead of the U.S. market open this Tuesday, the stock was c.1% to the good in pre-market trading at around $162.84. It is nevertheless a healthy 52% up over the past one year from the $105 mark.</p><div><div><img src="https://specials-images.forbesimg.com/imageserve/41455412/960x0.jpg?fit=scale" /></div><div><div><p>Apple Inc. iPhones and iPad tablet computers displayed for sale at an AT&amp;T Inc. store in Newport Beach, California, U.S., August 10, 2017. (Photographer: Patrick T. Fallon/Bloomberg).</p></div></div></div><p><strong>A High Price To Pay?</strong></p><p>Could though the expectation that the new model will cost over $1,000 and a rumored lack of new features dampen enthusiasm for new device?</p><p>On this score, Jordan Hiscott, Chief Trader at <a href="http://www.ayondo.com/">ayondo markets</a>, said: “In my opinion, probably not, though it is worth noting that Apple now appears to be positioning itself in the high-end/premium market, breaking with the tradition of trying to compete with the mass market deals of Android.”</p><p>The importance of this device launch is “not just hardware sales”, but also what it means for customer loyalty and the Apple ecosystem according to Neil Wilson, senior markets analyst at brokerage<a href="http://www.etxcapital.com/"> ETX Capital</a> in The City.</p><p>“We note a potential risk if the new devices are priced too highly for customers to upgrade,” he said. “If as anticipated it is priced around $1,000, the entry point is high and will make it more expensive than the MacBook Air. This will undoubtedly test some consumers’ willingness to upgrade.”</p><p>That said, Apple customers tend to be loyal and this price has been known to the market for several days, so should not come as a surprise to investors.</p><p>On this front Apple has form. It likes to set trends so the push for a more expensive, higher spec device as standard can be seen as the company once again setting the pace for the rest to follow.</p><p>As Wilson pointed out: “It might be a high price but Apple has worked out that its iPhones are now indispensable to their owners and they will upgrade whatever.  This looks like classic Apple…create something with existing technology (e.g. the OLED screen) and set the pace elsewhere, (e.g. price/design/usability).”</p><p>Apple is not always first with the tech, but manages to package it into a design and UX (user experience) that consumers go for.</p><p>The analyst posited that it would seem likely that consumers will be “elastic to the price change”, although the British market may be a special case given the weakness of sterling inflating prices further.</p><p>New devices that had retailed for around $800 last year would have set U.K. consumers back around £500 pre the Brexit referendum vote. Now a device costing $1,000 today would set British consumers back c.£800. Clearly that is a significant price increase that may have implications for some retailers.</p><p>And arguably this is a device not aimed at mature U.S. and European markets, but at Greater China, where Apple has suffered falling sales.</p><p>The London-based Scot ventured that: “The high spec, high price iPhone 8 should offer Apple a stronger, more differentiated position in this particular market. The market [Greater China] accounts for about one fifth of Apple’s revenues, but revenues decline 17% last year. A return to growth here is important and the new cycle offers a compelling argument for this to happen in FY2018.”</p><p>The design refresh is also important for Apple in shaping how it takes the iPhone over the next decade.</p><p>It should come as “no surprise” according to Wilson that expected changes to the hardware reflect changes happening elsewhere in consumer technology - for example with augmented reality (AR) and facial recognition technology.  These in turn can help lift software/app sales; e.g. AR, gaming, financial services. Again though the ecosystem is where it really matters for ensuring sustainable growth.</p><p>In its latest trading update, Apple offered guidance for the fiscal fourth quarter (Q4) of revenues between $49 billion (bn) and $52bn, which would equate to a rise of between 5% and 11% over the corresponding quarter a year earlier.</p><p>“This indicates confidence that the upgrade cycle will be strong and there is yet nothing to dent this view,” Wilson stated. “The iPhone 7, which was not a full upgrade cycle, delivered stronger-than-expected sales which suggest a supportive consumer environment for the 8th generation, even if it does look a tad pricey for some.”</p><p><strong>Services Crucial For Stock Price</strong></p><p>The latest trading update revealed that Service revenues rose 22% to $7.3 billion, which is a blockbuster number by any measure that makes this division the size of a Fortune 100 company all by itself -  and bigger than Amazon Web Services.</p><p>Services delivered nearly half of all the $3bn year-on-year revenue growth for Apple during the last quarter. And, it is the rising level Services revenues that make <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/rogeraitken/2017/08/02/apple-set-to-push-dow-past-22000-mark-ripe-for-rerating/">Apple “ripe for a re-rating”</a> according to ETX Capital’s Wilson.</p><p>At the present time it is trading as a hardware company, with a price to earnings (P-E) ratio in the region of 18x (trailing twelve months (ttm)) and compares with peers like Alphabet at 34x, Facebook 37x, Netflix at 222x and Amazon at an incredible 246x.</p><p>Higher earnings from Services ought to change this. These are more sustainable revenues and unlike iPhone sales, are neither dependent on delivering the next big product upgrade nor seasonal.</p><p>Services also help support new iPhone sales since they build loyalty in the Apple ecosystem. This is particularly important in the Greater China market, where the company is struggling relative to every other region. Furthermore it also boosts sales of other products as consumers stick to all things Apple, e.g. Macbook, Apple Watch.</p><p>Taken together, the various product improvements to be announced by Apple could not only “get hardware sales going again, but also further drive earnings in Services”, as some like Wilson contend.</p><p>In early trading at 10:37 a.m. in New York today, Apple’s stock was trading on Nasdaq down 0.41% (-$0.65) at $160.85.</p></div>',
